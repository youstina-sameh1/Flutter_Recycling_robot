# ♻️ Flutter Recycling Robot App 🤖
An intelligent robot powered by AI and a high-resolution camera to automatically classify and sort waste (plastic, paper, glass, metal). It connects to a mobile app that provides recycling suggestions and encourages users to benefit from recyclable materials.


## 📱 Application Description

This Flutter application is part of a recycling robot project. The app allows users to either **take a photo using the camera** or **choose an image from the gallery** to display a piece of waste. Once the image is selected, the app sends it for analysis using AI.

The system provides:

- **A detailed analysis** of the item in the image.
- **Creative ideas** and suggestions on how to **reuse or recycle** the item in an eco-friendly way.
- A built-in **AI-powered chat assistant**, which helps users by offering more tips, solutions, and recycling ideas based on the type of waste detected.

The app aims to encourage sustainability and raise awareness about smart recycling through an interactive and intelligent user experience.


## 👩‍💻 My Role

I was responsible for **designing and developing the mobile application using Flutter**.
